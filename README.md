# Running the project

The project is up and running at this url: 

 [Sample Workflow Editor (hamed-mahdizadeh.bitbucket.io)](https://hamed-mahdizadeh.github.io/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

First please clone the repository and run `npm install` command.

Then you can run the project by running `npm start` command.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Using the application:

To add new nodes, simply drag them from the search results and drop them into the blue area below the search bar.

Moving nodes within the editing area is as simple as dragging and dropping them to your desired location.

Draw connection between nodes by click on front part of the nodes and keep mouse click down and release it on the back part of target node

Items can currently be moved out of the blue area, which is unintended and should be addressed as a bug that needs fixing.

Please note that the feature to create connections between nodes has not been implemented yet.

Unfortunately, the application is currently not compatible with mobile browsers because the alternative method for dragging hasn't been developed for mobile devices.

While some logic have been incorporated into the code to facilitate node connections, this functionality remains unavailable due to ongoing development work on the completion logic.
